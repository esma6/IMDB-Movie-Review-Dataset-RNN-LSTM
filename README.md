# IMDB-Movie-Review-Dataset-RNN-LSTM
In this project, we will build a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network to solve a binary sentiment analysis problem.

For this, we'll use the â€œIMDB Movie Review Dataset" available on Keras. It includes 50000 highly polarized movie reviews categorized as positive or negative.
